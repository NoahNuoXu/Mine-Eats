## Summary of the Project
Since we have a COVID-19 situation in the real world, the project will simulate a city where be about food delivery by an agent to customers in different locations. The agent will decide which order should be delivered first based on the ordering time and distance. The input should be the number and location of the customers, order time, distance, number of orders, and maybe a restaurant location. The goal of this project is to find the best way to deliver the food in the shortest time and distance.

## AI/ML Algorithms
The project will be used Reinforcement Learning and Greedy Algorithm to calculate the main goal of our project.
