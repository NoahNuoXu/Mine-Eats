## Project Summary ##

  Our hero Sam will fight with zombies in a 16x16 place. The difference between our Sam and Sam who in the video game is that our Sam is using golden sword to fight. Sam is able to  move and turn around to deal damage and try to kill all the zombies from all directions. Under 20 seconds limit, Sam will try to kill all the enemies while avoiding as less damage as possible. 
  
## Approach ##




## Evaluation ##



## Remaining Goals and Challenges ## 

  For the update version in the future, we expect our hero Sam will be able to move and turn around faster for dodging the attacks from the enemies. Moreover, Sam's attacking timing is also need to be improved; so, Sam can deal more damage to kill enemies. the enemies will spawn randomly in the map. For answering this, we need to improve our Q table, angle and choosing target functions to make the situation better. For instance, which direction should the agent turn, which way has less enemies, avoiding to get knock back into walls or corners and attack faster and more accuracy.
If we can do all of these above, maybe we can try different enemies like witches who can fly in the air; so, Sam should switch weapon like bow to shoot witches.
